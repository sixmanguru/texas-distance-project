I went with a baker's dozen runner here because my simulated times had a bunch of runners grouped together along 8-13. What initially stands out is the fact the top-3 runners from Region 3 sit at the top. They also happen to be the top-3 returners from a year ago. Fitzgerald (2nd), Huntress (6th) and Asbill (5th) have shown they belong and their performances a week ago at the regional meet only emphasize that fact. Malan was 12th a year ago and Arceneau was 9th.   
  
Right now, Fitzgerald looks to be the one to beat. He placed third at the UIL State Track and Field Meet in the 3200m last year and is the leading returner from that race a year ago. Huntress is the top 800m runner in the state, having placed second last year at State. He also edged Fitzgerald in the 1600m at both Regionals and State a year ago. 

I would not put it past Asbill to try and send it early after what transpired at Regionals, but am not sure if he can shake everyone over the long haul.

**RUNNER**| **TEAM**  
---|---  
Aiden Fitzgerald| Friendswood  
Colby Huntress| Austin Anderson  
Jaxon Asbill| Dayton  
Tyler Connelly| Aledo  
Nathan Salinas| Mission Sharyland  
Juan Gallegos| Grapevine  
Matthew Morales| Georgetown  
Andrew Malan| Frisco Lebanon Trail  
Aaron Nava| Weslaco East  
Alexander Nava| Weslaco East  
Tristan Arceneau| Lucas Lovejoy  
Joseph Reid| Lucas Lovejoy  
Jack Gurwitz| McAllen  
  
The team race should be very exciting. Defending champion, Lovejoy, is down the list with Grapevine back at the top. Weslaco East has a very consistent squad. It would not surprise me if McAllen sneaked into the top-2 either. As usual, this race will come down to how the 4-5 runners finish and who can pass the most runners in the final 400m.

**TEAM**| **SCORE**  
---|---  
Grapevine| 98  
Weslaco East| 102  
McAllen| 130  
Dallas Wilson| 168  
Georgetown East View| 175  
Lucas Lovejoy| 179
