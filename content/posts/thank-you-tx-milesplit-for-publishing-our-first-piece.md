We are happy to be a part of Texas MileSplit as a part-time contributor. I want one thing to be clear, I am not paid by MS, nor am I a coach. I am a parent with kids who run and enjoy publicizing kids who run fast. I started this because I felt that much of the coverage gets splintered throughout the year. What I mean by that is, there seem to be a lot of freelancers who cover areas of the state or specific events. Sprints tend to get a lot of coverage. This is all great, but I like to get a little more in depth on what is happening in events like the 800, 1600 and 3200 (as well as Cross Country).

The first article was just a test on the art of the possible for this project. I will refine it as the weeks go along.

Please feel free to give comments and post suggestions. [For now, enjoy the first article published](https://tx.milesplit.com/articles/355916/texas-boys-distance-project) (2/21). I am sorry it only mentions the boys. As this was an experiment, I started there. I will definitely include the girls in the coming weeks.
