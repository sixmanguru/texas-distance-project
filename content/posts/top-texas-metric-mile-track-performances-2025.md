For the second year in a row, Caden Leonard lead the way for the boys in the 1600m statewide. Leonard shaved a mere 0.05 off his time in 2024 to drop his PR to 4:02.41 at the Hoka Festival of Miles in St. Louis. Noah Strohman was able to drop his PR by almost a second and a half at RunningLane,  
  
Probably what stands out most was that most of the best runs were after the UIL season or at premiere meets later in the season where the competition is stacked. Gavin Chapa, now at Texas A&M, won Texas Relays.

As far as state titles go, Strohman and his brother Ryder went 1-2 in 3A. The brotherly celebration was epic, as Noah turned and grabbed his brother after he crossed the line. Victor Aviles capped a great career at Burnet winning the 800, 1600 and 3200 in 4A. Caden Gary won a rain-delayed Class 5A title. Leonard edged Benjamin Montgomery for the 6A crown.

On the girls' side, 13 ladies went under 4:50, up from only seven a year ago. Again, most of the best marks were at top events like Hoka Festival of Miles, Nike, RunningLane or the State Meet.

Elin Latta, who is home-schooled and only listed a freshman, led the way with an incredible 4:34.87, almost five and a half seconds clear of the Sophia Bendet's 4:40.14.

At the 2025 UIL State Championships, the 6A division was loaded. Flower Mound's Alexandra Fox (now at Texas A&M) took the title with a final lap surge over Macy Wingard of Denton Braswell (a BYU commit). Emma Wade of Vista Ridge in Cedar Park (now at Oklahoma State) set a PR for third and Rowan Saacke (Colorado commit) was fourth.

In 5A it was a squeaker with Reese Pena edging Dana Rojas Vazquez and Molly Garrison. Pena won by a mere 0.008 of a second over Rojas Vazquez!
