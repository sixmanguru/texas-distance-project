There's a particular kind of excellence that's easy to overlook. It lives in the silver medals, the third-place finishes, the podium appearances that don't quite reach the top step. When you're watching Macy Wingard race cross country, it's easy to forget that version of her exists at all. On a grass course, she's untouchable — a front-runner who doesn't so much race her competition as leave them behind. But switch the surface to a track, and the story gets more complicated, and far more interesting.

Wingard is, without question, the greatest cross country runner in Braswell High School history — and arguably the greatest in Denton County, too. As a sophomore in 2023, she made history by becoming the first state champion in any sport in Braswell's young existence, winning the UIL 6A cross country title in 16:57 at Old Settlers Park. She backed it up as a junior in 2024 and then again in dominant fashion in November 2025, going 16:45.7 and finishing a staggering 23.9 seconds ahead of second place — the fifth-fastest 5K winning time in UIL history. Three state titles in four years. A three-time All-American. The 2025-26 Gatorade Texas Girls Cross Country Player of the Year. A legacy that places her alongside the all-time greats of Texas distance running.

And yet, every spring, she trades the trails for the track. And every spring, the gold medals have gone home with someone else.

## A Pattern Written in Silver

Look at Wingard's track career and a clear narrative emerges. As a freshman, she placed second in both the 1,600 and 3,200 at the district meet before finding her footing at the deeper levels of competition. By her sophomore year, she was on the podium at the state meet — third in the 1,600, second in the 3,200 — close, but not there. As a junior, she was even better, winning district and regional titles in both events, and heading into the 2025 state meet as a legitimate contender in both races. The result? Runner-up in the 1,600, runner-up in the 3,200. Silver medals that would look like gold in any other career, but that sting differently when you've spent fall after fall knowing what a finish-line tape feels like against your chest.

This is the central tension of Macy Wingard's prep career: in cross country, she is the hunted. On the track, she has been the hunter — always close, always dangerous, never quite able to close the deal.

## What Makes the Track Different

It's worth asking why. The answer likely lies in the nature of track racing itself. Cross country rewards the pure distance runner — the athlete who can sustain a ferocious tempo over rolling terrain for 5,000 meters, who can run away from a field before they ever get settled. Wingard does this better than anyone in Texas. She is, by temperament and training, a front-runner. She doesn't need someone to race. She sets a pace and she dares the field to come with her.

Track, especially the 1,600, doesn't always cooperate with that approach. At the elite high school level, the mile and two-mile are tactical events full of athletes who can turn their legs over with genuine speed, runners who will happily sit in, draft, and then unleash a devastating kick in the final 200 meters. For an athlete who has spent four years building massive aerobic capacity and mental toughness over longer efforts, that final lap can be a different kind of reckoning.

But here's the thing: Wingard knows this. Her coaches know this. And going into her senior track season, she enters as the most experienced, most decorated, most motivated version of herself she has ever been.

## The Senior Season Stakes

She's a three-time state cross country champion. She's committed to BYU, one of the premier distance running programs in the country, where she'll train alongside future professional runners. She holds the No. 2 all-time Texas prep mark in the 2,000m steeplechase. There is almost nothing left to prove.

Almost.

The one thing missing from the mantle is a UIL state track title. And for a competitor of Wingard's caliber, you better believe that absence is felt. Senior year is a final accounting — a last opportunity to tie off the loose ends of a high school career and leave with nothing unfinished.

The field won't be easy. Texas 6A distance running is brutally competitive, with talented runners from across the state contesting every heat and final. But Wingard will arrive at the regional and state meets in the spring as the most accomplished distance runner in the field by a considerable margin. She has run these races before. She knows what it costs. And she has never been better prepared.

## More Than the Results

Even if the track gold remains elusive — even if fate conspires one more time for silver — it wouldn't diminish what Wingard has built. She finishes her prep career as a three-time state champion, a national-caliber runner, a 4.78 GPA student, a community servant, and a Gatorade award winner. She gave Braswell its first state title in any sport and then gave it two more. She is the standard against which future Bengal distance runners will measure themselves for generations.

But Macy Wingard doesn't seem like someone who keeps score that way. She seems like someone who lines up and runs as hard as she can and lets the times speak for themselves.

This spring, the times she's been chasing will be within reach one final time.

It's a good bet she'll be running from the front.
