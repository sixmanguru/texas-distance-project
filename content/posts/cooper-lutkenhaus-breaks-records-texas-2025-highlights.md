I thought I would take minute to review some of the top Texan results for the 2025 Outdoor Season now that the summer Nationals are complete.  
  
Obviously no list or conversation can start without mentioning what Cooper Lutkenhaus did at the US National Championships. I was lucky enough to be in Heyward the afternoon he broke Michael Granville's 29-year old record at Nike. The weather wasn't great and I really didn't think he'd have a legit shot. The day before when Luke Bone ran the 7th or 8th best all-time (at the time) during the U20 Final, the weather was much nicer. So when Coop broke the record, the place went crazy.

So we get to the 'Senior' Championships and Cooper has amazed everyone by getting through the rounds. The semis almost gave me a heart attack when he stumbled, but his recovery, focus and shear determination got him through. Every race looked like that would be it for the high school sophomore. Then came the final. Earlier in the day I got a message from his dad, "Perfect day to race today in the final! Will see what he has left."

And boy did we.

I scared the daylights out of my dog screaming at the TV and that was because he had qualified for the World Championships in Tokyo. I hadn't seen the time - **1:42.27**. My phone blew up with messages from parents and friends around the state losing their minds.

He obliterated the previous world best for an Under-18 athlete. It surpassed the former U18 world best, held by Timothy Kitum since the 2012 London Olympics, by a staggering 1.1 seconds. It is also faster than the age-17 and age-18 world records. His performance instantly placed him at No. 4 on the U.S. all-time performer list and ranks him as the 18th fastest in world history.

He broke his own personal best (from Nike) by almost three seconds and has been called one of the most astonishing performances in American track history, defying typical limitations of age, experience, and high school competition.

It couldn't have happened to a nicer kid from a nicer family. Of course he has now turned pro and will forego his high school eligibility.

Additional shoutouts to Luke Bone (mentioned above) who finished behind Cooper at the State Meet in 6A and is now heading to Texas Tech and Caden Gary, who capped a great season season winning the 5A 800 and 1600. He's heading to A&M but I was under the impression he was not going to continue running, although that may change.

Colby Huntress will be the top returning high schooler in the state next spring at 800 meters.

And lastly, I would like to say congratulations to Evan Martin from Rockwall Heath who qualified for UIL in Cross Country, Track (800m) and Golf! That's a crazy triple.
