Defending champ Wingard is the favorite but the addition of Laney Barnes could make this interesting. Of course Easterwood could also play into the mix. I am curious how the Bridgeland girls will fit in. Will this be the race they dominate

**RUNNER**| **TEAM**  
---|---  
Macy Wingard| Denton Braswell  
Laney Barnes| Houston Cyp. Woods  
Maya Easterwood| Coppell  
Evangeline Williams| Wylie East  
Hope Smith| Bridgeland  
Naomi Weller| Conroe The Woodlands  
Caroline Strong| Austin Westlake  
Rowan Saacke| Bridgeland  
Adeline Bennett| Flower Mound  
Kylie Vega| El Paso Eastwood  
  
The team race looks like a slam dunk for Bridgeland but you can never count out the experience of Flower Mound. The way it looks though is that it won't get interesting until after the top-3 podium spots.

Bridgeland| 33  
Flower Mound| 72  
Conroe The Woodlands| 102
