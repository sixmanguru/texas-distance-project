Despite the fact that their PRs were elsewhere, the Class 6A 3200 at the 2025 UIL State Track and Field Championships was the race of the year in that event. Six runners were within half a second of each other at the bell between 8:01.66 and 8:02.047 and if you wanted to make the podium you had to drop a sub-57 last lap. Caden Leonard held on for the win over Danny Torres and Benjamin Montgomery. Gavin Chapa's 58.67 final lap was only good enough for fourth. Freshman Ruel Newberry's 1:06 final lap left him in sixth.  
  
It will be interesting to see who challenges Leonard in 2026. Right now the top contenders are Griffen Saacke and Newberry.

It's funny, I was at the Music City Track Carnival and watched the 3200m, but the only thing I remember was Latta putting the hammer down around the halfway mark and never looking during a windy evening in Cleveland, Tennessee.

At the state meet, it was Eva Cragnolino taking the 5A title for Austin LASA over Lilly Koenig of Smithson Valley. At the 6A level, Rowan Saacke of Bridgeland used a final lap 1:08.8 to pass and pull away from Macy Wingard of Denton Braswell, 10:05.90 to 1:08.04. What is exciting for track fans is these two have another year to keep this rivalry alive. Add in Maya Easterwood, who was only a sophomore from Coppell and this event will be one to watch some future May Friday morning in Austin.
