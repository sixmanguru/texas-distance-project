Welcome to the second week of the Texas Distance Project, where we give you an update on how middle distance and distance runner excelled over the previous week.

Since we missed the girls last week, we will start there. One caveat, there were many meets that were cancelled due to the cold and wet conditions. Since meets around Austin were cancelled, many competed for their clubs at the Viper Distance Festival where there were some blistering early season results.

We also recognize that many events were not properly recorded. If a meet is missing, please make sure your coaches update that information at MileSplit.

**800M**

There were some great times this week despite the chilly weather across the state. A total of 13 ladies beat this week’s standard of sub-2:21.

Training partners Faith Murphy (Austin Anderson) and Emma Wade (Vista Ridge) set the standard by going 2:10.40 and 2:13.94. Both of these ladies have State Meet experience and seem to be in great form early at Viper. Murphy, an Arkansas signee, was second at last year’s state meet in this event. Murphy’s time is the fastest in the state so far.

Not to be outdone, the Allen Eagle Relays also produced some great time. Nora Ryan (Prosper) edged Lovejoy’s Mia Reaugh and teammate Erin Young, winning in 2:15.79. That time is just off her PR of 2:15.35. Reaugh, who like Murphy is a 400m specialist as well, having gone 56.29 last season did set a PR with her time of 2:16.12.

**1600M**

Evanna Jacobsen, a Baylor commit, not only captured the Lake Ridge Invitational 800m in 2:17.80, she also clocked week-leading 1600m in 5:11.35. Jacobsen has solid range, having also competed in the 300m hurdles, as well as the steeplechase within the past year.

Not to be outdone, junior Tibbie Mustacchia of Austin Vandergrift followed up her 5:14 last week with a 5:11.50 at the Viper Distance Festival where she beat teammate Cate Cloran (5:13.33).

**3200M**

A total of nine girls registered this week’s sub-11:24 standard.

Flower Mound’s Adeline Bennett, who is only a sophomore, had the fasted time of the week I the 3200m and the only sub-11 effort, coming in at 10:36.09 at the Hebron Hawk Invitational. The sophomore was coming off a week where she also crushed both the 800m and 1600m at the Bryson Nelson Invitational a week ago.

Bridget Bernal took the 3200m at the Allen Eagle Relays in 11:06.37, lowering her PR and dropping over 20 seconds off her time a week prior. The junior is 2-for-2 in wins for her 3200s so far in 2025, an event that is new to her this season.

Alivia Spangler, a junior from Prosper, won the 1600m at the Allen Eagle Relays in 5:12.25 but was even more impressive was her 11:12.44 3200m. She dropped 22 seconds off her time from the week before. She’s gone sub-11 in the past and also has a 5:07 1600m in the books so I expect her to drop even more time as the season progresses.

Manfield Lake Ridge’s Meagan Meyers captured her home meet in 11:14.94. A regional finalist a year ago in both the 1600 and 3200, she looks to build on a solid early season and make a run for State in what is a tough region (6A-1).

**BOYS**

**800M**

Manfield Summit’s Eduardo Estrada led the boys this week with a 1:56.28, winning the Lake Ridge Invitational. Estrada ran 1:55.52 to a sixth-place finish at state a year ago and is actually the top returner from that heat, as Cooper Lutkenhaus and Justin Northwest moved to 6A.

Josh Odums of Mansfield Legacy was the only other runner this week under 1:57. Odums is coming off a solid XC season where he finished top-40 at State.

Liam Bengtsson of Nelson ran 1:57.76. Bengtsson could make a huge leap this weekend at the Justin Northwest 1k with Lutkenhaus if he can hang on. It will be a big opportunity to show what he can do.

**1600M**

Austin High’s Luke Bone ran the fastest outdoor time in the state so far at the Viper Distance Festival, dropping a 4:14.22. That’s a big PR for the Texas Tech signee who focused solely on the 800m last year, garnering a State berth, as well as a spot in the U20 final in Eugene, Oregon last summer.

Northwest Byron Nelson’s Jason Wade garnered a PR, going 4:18.57 and winning the Argyle Relays. He’s about 20 seconds ahead of where he was at the same time last year and that bodes well for a great outdoor season.

Jackson Stafford of Vandergrift (4:19.23) and Aiden Fitzgerald of Friendswood (4:19.26) were neck and neck down the stretch at the Viper Distance Festival. We spoke about Stafford last week (1:55.74 800) and he continues to impress.

Fitzgerald was second at the 5A State XC Championships this fall and was 4th a year ago at the State Meet in the 3200m. It will be curious to see if he tries to compete the 1600/3200 combo this year when championship season rolls around.

**3200M**

The 3200m at the Viper Distance Festival was by far the most dominant and competitive event in the state last week. With ten runners under 9:30 it was impressive, considering it was about 40 degrees and misting off and on from what I was told.

Austin Bowie junior Griffin Hummel won the race in an impressive 9:11.11 over three close competitors from Vandergrift. Sophomore Collin Goodwin (9:13.30) is starting to make a name for himself with the Vipers outpacing his teammates, Princeton signee Hudson Haley (9:14.90), Kai McCullough (9:16.28) and Miles Nutt (9:25.75).

Marco Cunningham, a senior and the defending 2A State Cross Country champion from Waco Meyer, set a PR as well in 9:18.88. Meyer finished 2nd at the 1600 and 3200 in 2023 at the State Meet, but settled for 7th a year ago in the 1600m. He appears ready to challenge for both titles in 2025.

Marble Falls’ Tyler Hamblin is another athlete who looks to be building nicely off a strong XC season. Hamblin finished 4th at the State XC Meet in 4A and was a sixth place finisher in the 3200 a year ago.
