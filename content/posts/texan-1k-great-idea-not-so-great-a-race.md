The Northwest Texan Invitational 1k US High School Record attempt didn’t go as planned, however that does not mean it was a failure.  
  
Sure, nobody broke the record and the entire field looked bummed after the race, but as someone who was there, it was definitely a success. This race gave all of those kids a taste of big time racing very early in the outdoor season. Some would probably say too early in the outdoor season, but with the way the UIL schedule is so compressed (that’s a topic for another day), there’s really not a good place to put it, unless you add it to TDF or an event like that.

The race started strong. Cooper Lutkenhaus took them through in sub-25 to start, but the second 200 ground to a 30. That’s not bad if you pick the pace up, however, the entire group stayed at that pace and took the second 400 in approximately 61.

Going through 800m at 1:56-1:57 was not the plan. 1:53 was the basic goal with 1:50-1:51 being the best-case scenario. At around 725-750, Colby Huntress attacked and the group responded well. For a split second it looked like they may pull some of the distance back from Lutkenhaus, but at the 800m mark, he pulled out his patented kick.

By the time they reached the home stretch, Lutkenhaus was way out with Caden Gary and Huntress leading the chase group. In the end, that is the way they finished.

I am not sure any of the competitors were happy, but if there’s a bright spot it would have to be Caden Gary and Zach Brumfield. Gary missed Cross Country season with an injury after a great outdoor season a year ago. It had to feel good to get back out there with the big boys and know you’ve still got it. Brumfield handled himself well in a high-class field. For a guy with a 1:54 PR in the 800m, he finished very well.

The bottom line is many of these runners are not in Championship Season form. The goal is to peak in two months. Most have probably not put in too much speed work just yet. They also have never raced that distance and This race would have a whole different look if these same guys hit the track in May after State.

What do you say TTFCA, how about a rematch at the Meet of Champions?
