This is a website created to cover the best runners in Texas in events 800m and beyond. Come here every week during the indoor and outdoor seasons to follow how Texas runners are faring.

The Texas Distance Project tracks athletes across all UIL classifications, from 1A through 6A, with a focus on the 800m, 1600m, and 3200m events. We cover cross country in the fall and track in the spring, with analysis, predictions, rankings, and storytelling throughout the year.
